# Power Cells

A platform fighter grown as a spiritual successor to Dead Cells, and borrowing elements from other roguelikes.

Originally created in Unity version 2021.1.17f1, and compatible with all versions using the same input system.

### **Usage**

**Controls**

WASD/arrow keys for movement left and right
Space for Jumping
leftCTRL/Mouse 1 for attacking

**Goal**

The game is made up of a starting room, 4 randomly generated rooms from a list, and a 5th ending room, there is no time check, no score, no enemies, as it is only a tech demo at the moment.

#### **Development and future**

I wish to create some method of creating sprites by rendering 3D assets before the development continues, the spcene looks increddibly bland and boring without any sort of creatures littering the place.
Particle effects will be hand crafted however, to give a better retro look to the game, and sounds are not yet planned, nor any changes in the soundtrack.
